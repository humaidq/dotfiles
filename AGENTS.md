# Agent Guidance

This repository contains my personal NixOS flake along with modules and host definitions.

## Contributing
- Ensure the flake evaluates and hosts build by running `nix flake check` before pushing.
- Format all files using the repository's formatter with `nix fmt`.
- Keep commit messages concise and descriptive.
